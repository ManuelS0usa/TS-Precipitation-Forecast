# Precipitation Forecast using Machine Learning Time Series Algorithms
### Time Series Machine Learning Project | Manuel Sousa | 25.04.2022

### Context
Viveiros Monterosa [http://www.monterosa.pt/pt/] are a flower production company from the south of Portugal, more specifically, Moncarapacho, Olh√£o. To produce their plants the company have their production fields equipped with multiple sensors in order to efficiently control and understand the yearly climate enviroment. This project takes advantages of their precipitation sensors collected data, grouped by month.

### Scripts
The following scripts were built in the scope of the development of this project:
* data_load.py: Import and transform the data;
* eda notebook: Exploratory data analysis;
* arma_models notebook: Time series arma and holt-winters based models;
* rnn_models: recurrent neural networks (LSTM) time series based models.
